    <h1> ABOUT </h1>
    <h2>About </h2>
    <p>My name is Lawrence Salinas and I am an aspiring web developer, I am convinced that Lambda will give me
        the best chance in a career in technology.
        I am a very driven and motivated person. I strongly believe that I will be able to take on the intense
        nature of the program. I am looking forward to starting a full-time job with the help of the Lambda
        program. In addition, it would be most beneficial and effective for me to work with mentors who are
        professionals in this field as well as working with fellow peers seeking the same goal. I hope to gain
        experience in web development and software engineering.</p>
